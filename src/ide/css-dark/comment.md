# css-dark/

The files in this folder provide the styles for the dark theme.
Because all the css is concatenated to a single css, all dark theme
tags should be prefixed with `.dark-theme <selector>`. Note that the absence
means that the styles at the given style selector are probably not
converted to dark theme. Only color properties should be used in the
dark theme when possible.
