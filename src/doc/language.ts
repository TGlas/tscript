		The syntax of the TScript language specifies whether a text is
		a well-formed (valid) or ill-formed (invalid) program. A
		well-formed program can be executed, while trying to run
		an ill-formed (or malformed) program results in an error
		message already before the program starts. The syntax is
		specified in terms of an

			<p>
			TScript source code consists of unicode characters from the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">Basic Multilingual Plane</a> (BMP).
			These characters have codes in the range U+0000 to U+FFFF.
			In other words, each character (or "code point") can be
			represented as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
			</p>
			<p>
			However, this document does not specify the <i>character
			encoding</i>, but only the <i>character set</i>. So for
			example UTF-8 encoded text is fine, as long as it does not
			contain code points above U+FFFF.
			</p>
			<p>
			Outside of
			<a href="?doc#/language/syntax/comments">comments</a> and
			<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/literals/strings">string literals</a>,
			only the printable ASCII range U+0020 to U+007E and the
			ASCII control characters U+0009 (horizontal tabulator),
			U+000A (line feed), and U+000D (carriage return) are valid.
			</p>
			<p>
			Inside comments and string literals, the full range U+0000
			to U+FFFF is legal. Every character can be denoted in plain
			ASCII by means of an escaping mechanism.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Note:</b>
			The TScript implementation is based directly on Javascript
			(ECMAScript&nbsp;6). Javascript allows its implementations
			to support the complete unicode range by composing
			characters outside the BMP with the UTF16 encoding, but this
			feature is not mandatory. In practice, Javascript engines do
			support the mechanism, which amounts to representing the
			unicode characters outside the BMP with two characters in
			the range U+0000 to U+FFFF. This solution is error-prone.
			For example, it is somewhat surprising if a string that
			prints as a single character consists of two characters, as
			revealed by the size method and when accessing the
			characters, slicing the string, etc. It is therefore
			recommended to restrict string contents to the BMP.

			<p>
			A TScript program consists of a sequence of tokens. Each
			token is a meaningful and often short string of characters
			with clear semantics. Tokens can be separated by whitespace,
			comments, other terminals, or they can be self-delimiting.
			A sequence of input characters that does not match any of
			the token types results in a syntax error. In this documentation
            the red-written expressions need to be replaced by the corresponding
            tokens. The "|" denote the logical or, "()" enclose connected tokens.
            "[]" express that the inner expressions are optional and therefore can
            be chosen zero or one times, "{}" express that the inner expressions can
            be chosen zero or n times.
			</p>

			<h2>Whitespace and Comments</h2>
			<p>
			Whitespace and
			<a href="?doc#/language/syntax/comments">comments</a> are not
			by themselves considered tokens, but they separate tokens
			and therefore they must be defined:
			<ebnf>
				whitespace = " " | tabulator | carriage-return | line-feed ;
				tabulator = $ U+0009 $ ;
				carriage-return = $ U+000A $ ;
				line-feed = $ U+000D $ ;
				comment = line-comment | block-comment ;
				line-comment = "#" (unicode-char - "*" - line-feed)
				                   { unicode-char - line-feed } ;                           "example: # this is a comment       "
				block-comment = "#*" { (unicode-char - "*")                                 "example: #* this is a              "
				                       | ("*" { "*" } (unicode-char - "#"))                 "            multiline comment *#   "
				                     } "*#" ;
				unicode-char = $ any Unicode character U+0000 to U+FFFF $ ;
			</ebnf>
			</p>

			<h2>Identifiers and Keywords</h2>
			<p>
			An identifier is defined as follows:
			<ebnf>
				identifier = id_or_key - keyword ;                                          "example: _x, x, X, x2 are correct identifiers  "
				id_or_key = (letter | "_") { letter | digit | "_" } ;                       "example: 2X, 3x, var  are incorrect identifiers"
				letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
				       | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
				       | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
				       | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b"
				       | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
				       | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p"
				       | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w"
				       | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
				digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6"
				      | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
				keyword = $ list of TScript keywords $ ;
			</ebnf>
			It is essentially a non-empty name consisting of letters,
			digits and underscores that does not start with a digit.
			For the definition of <ebnf>keyword</ebnf> see the
			<a href="?doc#/language/syntax/keywords">list of keywords</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Integers</h2>
			<p>
			An integer is simply defined as a non-empty sequence of
			digits:
			<ebnf>
				integer = digit { digit } ;
			</ebnf>
			Too large tokens exceeding the
			<a href="?doc#/language/types/integer">integer</a> range result
			in an error message when parsing the literal formed from the
			token.
			</p>

			<h2>Reals</h2>
			<p>
			A real must contain a fractional part, or an exponent, or both:
			<ebnf>
				real = integer "." integer                                                  "example: 2.523                     "
					 | integer ("e" | "E") [ "+" | "-" ] integer                            "example: 1e2, 1e-5                 "
				     | integer "." integer ("e" | "E") [ "+" | "-" ] integer ;              "example: 1.5e3                     "
			</ebnf>
			</p>

			<h2>Strings</h2>
			<p>
			Simple strings are character sequences enclosed in double
			quotes. A string token can contain escape sequences. It is
			defined as follows:
			<ebnf>
				string = '"' { (unicode-char - "\\" - line-feed) | escape } '"' ;
				escape = "\\" "\\"
				       | "\\" '"'
				       | "\\" "r"
				       | "\\" "n"
				       | "\\" "t"
				       | "\\" "f"
				       | "\\" "b"
				       | "\\" "/"
				       | "\\" "u" hex hex hex hex ;
				hex = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"
				            | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" ;
			</ebnf>
			A <a href="?doc#/language/expressions/literals/strings">string literal</a>
			can consist of multiple such tokens.
			</p>

			<h2>Operators, Groupings, and Separators</h2>
			<p>
			For these simple token types, we let the definition speak
			for itself. Note that some operators start with a shorter
			sequence that also forms an operator. The token is always
			the longest possible sequence.
			</p>
			<ebnf>
				operator = arithmetic_op | compare_op | assign-op ;
				binary-op = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "//" | "%" | "^" ;
				compare_op = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" ;
				assign-op = "=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/=" | "%=" | "^=" ;

			<p>
			Comments are pieces of program code without any semantic
			meaning. In other words, comments are ignored when running
			the program. While being ignored by the machine, they are
			intended to be read by humans, usually for the purpose of
			documentation. In TScript there are two types of comments:
			line comments and block comments.
			</p>
			<h2>Line Comments</h2>
			<p>
			Line comments start with the token
			<code class="code">#</code> not immediately followed by
			<code class="code">*</code> and extend to the end of the
			line. One beneficial property of line comments is that they
			can be nested, i.e.,
			<tscript>
				# # a nested line comment
			</tscript>
			is still a valid comment, since the fact that a comment is
			inside another comment is ignored.
			</p>
			<h2>Block Comments</h2>
			<p>
			Block comments start with <code class="code">#*</code> and end with
			<code class="code">*#</code>. In contrast to line comments, block
			comments are entirely free in their extent. They may span
			only a small part of a line or even multiple lines. The price to pay is that
			block comments cannot be nested, since in
			<div class="code"><pre class="code"><code class="code"><span class="code-comment">#* a broken #* block *#</span> comment *#</code></pre></div>
			the comment ends with the <i>first</i> occurrence of
			<code class="code">*#</code>, so that <code class="code">comment *</code> is
			interpreted as program code (which is most probably malformed),
			and the final <code class="code">#</code> as the start of a
			line comment.

			<p>
			In TScript, whitespace is useful for separating tokens, but
			it is insignificant for separating language constructs like
			definitions, statements, and directives. In particular,
			indentation is optional, and statements can extend beyond
			the end of the current line. Instead, declarations and
			statements are delimited by keywords and, in most cases,
			with a semicolon&nbsp;<tscript>;</tscript>. This means that
			in many cases the tokens in between semicolons form a single
			statement.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another useful structural property of the TScript language that
			becomes apparent already at the lexical level are parentheses
			<code class="code">( )</code>, square brackets <code class="code">[ ]</code>,
			and curly braces <code class="code">{ }</code>. The TScript syntax
			is designed so that opening and closing tokens must always match.
			For example, when encountering the sequence of tokens
			<code class="code">{(</code> then <code class="code">)</code> is fine, while
			encountering <code class="code">}</code> first indicates a syntax error.

			If a variable is not initialized (like <code class="code">a</code>
			in the above example), then it is implicitly set to
			<keyword>null</keyword>. Therefore the following two statements
			are equivalent:
			<tscript>
				var x;
			</tscript>
			<tscript>
				var x = null;
			</tscript>
			The variable name must not appear anywhere in its initializer,
			i.e., in the expression on the right hand side of the equals sign.
			</p>
			<p>
			Multiple variables can refer to the same value.
			<a href="?doc#/language/statements/assignments">Assigning</a> a value
			to a variable only references the value, it does not copy the value.
			It is different from initialization, and the variable itself may
			appear on the right hand side, referring to the old value before
			the actual assignment takes place:
			<tscript>
var x = 3;              # initialization
x = 2 * x + 1;          # assignment

var a = [0, 1, 2];
var b = a;

print(b);               # prints [0, 1, 2]
a.push(3);
print(b);               # prints [0, 1, 2, 3] ==> b is a reference to a, not a copy

var c = [0, 1, 2];
var d = deepcopy(c);

print(d);               # prints [0, 1, 2]
c.push(3);
print(d);               # prints [0, 1, 2] ==> d only copied the value of c
			</tscript>
			</p>
			<p>
			Parameters of functions are also variables, although they are
			declared without <keyword>var</keyword>
			(see <a href="?doc#/language/declarations/functions">functions</a>).
			They are initialized to a value provided by the function
			call or to their default value, if present. Default values
			are limited to constant expressions.
            <tscript>
            function example(a = 2) {       # 2 is the default value for a
                return a;
            }

            print(example());               # prints 2

            print(example(3));              # prints 3
            </tscript>
			</p>
			<p>
			Variables inside classes are called attributes. These variables
			can be initialized, but the initializer must evaluate to a
			constant. Variable that should be initialized to a value
			computed at runtime can be set in the constructor.
            <tscript>
            class example {
                private:
                    var x = 2;              # has to be a constant
                    var y;
                public:
                    constructor(a) {
                        y = a;              # if you want to enable dynamic initialisation of y
                    }
            }
            </tscript>
			</p>
			<p>
			Closure parameters are somewhere in between the above two cases.
			They are stored inside the function closure like attributes in
			an object. Whenever the closure is called they are copied, and
			the copies become parameters of the function.
			</p>

			<h2>Lifetime of Variables</h2>
			<p>
			TScript distinguishes three types of variables:
			<ul>
				<li>Global variables are declared at global scope, in a namespace, or as static attributes of global classes. They are available for the whole runtime of the program.</li>
				<li>Local variables are declared in a non-global non-class scope, or as parameters of a function or closure. They are available inside their defining scope, or for closure parameters, inside the function body. After the scope is left they "go out of scope" and cannot be accessed any more.</li>
				<li>Attributes are declared in a class scope. Non-static attributes are part of an object, and hence their lifetime is bound to the lifetime of the object.</li>
			</ul>
            <tscript do-not-run>
            var x = 1;                      # global declaration
            {
                print(x);                   # works
                var y = 2;                  # local declaration
            }
            print(y);                       # does not work
            </tscript>
			It may seem at first glance that binding a variable to a closure extends its lifetime to the lifetime of the closure. This is not the case. Instead, values are <i>copied</i> into closure parameters, which are independent variables, as demonstrated here:
			<tscript>
				function f()
				{
					var x = 42;
					var ret = function [x] () { return x; };
					x *= 2;
					return ret;
				}
				print(f()());   # prints 42, not 84
			</tscript>

			A function is a named block of code that can be invoked arbitrarily
			often, possibly with different parameter values.
			</p>

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<p>
			Functions are declared with the following syntax:
			<ebnf>
				func-decl = "function" identifier "(" param-list ")" func-body ;    "# function example() {}"
				  param-list = [ param-decl { "," param-decl } ] ;                  "# (ex, am, ple)"
				  param-decl = identifier [ "=" constant-ex ] ;                     "# ex or ex = 1"
				  constant-ex = $ expression that evaluates to a constant $ ;
				  func-body = "{" { declaration | statement | directive } "}" ;     "# { . . . }"
			</ebnf>
			It is referenced by its name, and invoked by
			<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/function-calls">providing
			values for the parameters in parentheses</a>. The effect of invoking a
			function is that the control flow is transferred to the function body.
			After the function body is left with a <keyword>return</keyword>
			statement or by reaching the end of the function body, the control flow
			is returned to the calling context.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<tscript>
					function circleArea(radius)
					{
						return math.pi() * radius * radius;
					}
					var func = circleArea;
					print(circleArea(3));   # prints 9*pi = 28.2743...
					print(func(3));         # prints 9*pi = 28.2743...
				</tscript>
			</div>
			<p>
			Parameters of functions are always named, with an optional default value.

		constructor(radius=1)                         # constructor, gets called by "var c = Circle(5)" and sets m_radius to handed value; if no value is given, sets radius to 1 by default

    			</tscript>
			</div>

			<h2>The Constructor</h2>
			<p>
			The constructor of a class is called whenever the class is instantiated,
			i.e., when a new object of that very class is created. Its role is to
			initialize the object's state, comprised by its attributes. Attributes
			can equally well be declared with a constant initializer. Non-constant
			(parameter-dependent) initialization is done in the constructor.
			Of course, the constructor can perform further tasks. Uninitialized
			members hold the value <keyword>null</keyword>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Classes with a public constructor can be instantiated from everywhere,
			and the same holds for classes without constructor (which implies the
			generation of a public default constructor). Constructors can also be
			protected or private. A class with private constructor can be
			instantiated only from within a method of the class, and the class
			cannot have sub-classes. A class with protected constructor can have
			sub-classes, since the constructor can be called from a sub-class
			constructor.
			</p>

			<h2>Static and Non-Static Members</h2>
			<p>
			Declarations inside the function body as known as members of the class.
			Members can be declared <keyword>static</keyword>. Static members belong
			to the class, not to its objects. For a static variable (also called a
			class variable) this means that a single instance of the variable with
			global lifetime exists, independent of the number of objects of the
			class. In contrast, the liftime of attributes (non-static variables) is
			bound to the object. A non-static function member is called a method.
			</p>
			<p>
			A public member of a class is referenced with the dot-operator, as seen
			in the example above. Inside the class, its members can be accessed by
			their names. The object itself, i.e., the left-hand-side of the
			<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/member-access">dot operator</a>,
			is available under the name <keyword>this</keyword>. A static function
			can be invoked without referring to an instance of the class, and hence
			<keyword>this</keyword> is undefined in a static function. The following
			example demonstrates static members:
			<tscript>
				class Counted
				{
				private:
					static var m_counter = 0;

				public:
					constructor() { m_counter += 1; }
					function doSomething() { #* dummy *# }
					static function numberOfInstances()
					{
						# doSomething();   # error; this is not defined
						# return this;     # error; this is not defined
						return m_counter;
					}
				}
				var a = Counted(), b = Counted(), c = Counted();
				print(Counted.numberOfInstances());
				print(a.numberOfInstances());
			</tscript>
			</p>

			<h2>Dynamic Dispatching</h2>
			<p>
			Member name lookup of the form <code class="code">a.numberOfInstances</code>
			in the above code happens dynamically at runtime. The result of the
			<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/member-access">member access</a> (and
			therefore, in this context, the invoked function) depends on the type
			of the left-hand-side, provided that multiple classes declare a member
			of the same name. This is an elegant mechanism for creating implicit
			switches in code based on the type of data it encounters. Referencing
			a member name that does not exist in the type (more precisely, in its
			public interface) results in an error message.
			</p>

			<h2>Visibility of Members</h2>
			<p>
			TScript classes allow for proper information hiding, i.e., they can
			hide implementation details behind a public or protected interface. From
			outside the class, only members declared <keyword>public</keyword> are
			visible, i.e., members following a <keyword>public</keyword> declaration.
			In addition, <keyword>protected</keyword> members are visible within
			sub-classes (see below), while <keyword>private</keyword> members are
			only visible within the class itself. It is common practice to declare
			most attributes as private to the class, and to provide access
			facilities in terms of protected and public methods.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also inside classes, the general principle that declarations can be
			used only after they were declared is applied. Therefore it is common
			practice to declare attributes towards the beginning of the class, so
			that they can be accessed by methods declared below them.
			</p>
			<p>
			Hiding information is not always necessary, and sometimes
			over-complicates matters. In some cases simple classes consisting
			only of public attributes are a meaningful choice. For example, the
			following class may represent a point in a two-dimensional coordinate
			system:
			<tscript>
				class Point
				{
				public:
					var x, y;

					constructor(x_, y_)
					{ x = x_; y = y_; }
				}

			</tscript>
			The same data can of course be held in an array
			<code class="code">[x,y]</code> or a dictionary
			<code class="code">{"x":x,"y":y}</code>, but the class has the
			advantages of making the role of the type and of its members explicit.
			This makes code more readable and more maintainable. Furthermore it
			adds the ability of code to test for its the data type to clarify the
			role of a value, which is not possible with generic containers since
			they are used for many purposes.
			</p>

			<h2>Inheritance</h2>
			<p>
			A class can be based on any other type, including all the
			<a href="?doc#/language/types">built-in types</a> (however, note that
			aggregation is often preferable over inheriting an immutable type).
			This means that the type, also known as the sub-class in this context,
			inherits all properties and members from its super-class.
			</p>
			<p>
			Subclassing is a common mechanism for extending the functionality of
			a type, and for creating a set of types with a uniform interface.
			The mechanism allows to override (generic) functionality of the base
			or super class with (specialized) functionality of the sub-class,
			simply by declaring a method of the same name as in the super class.
			This does not create a name conflict. When invoking such a method on
			an object of the sub-class then the dispatching rules dictate that the
			method declared in the sub-class is invoked, and the method in the
			super class is ignored.
			</p>
			<p>
			When implementing sub-classes, there regularly is the demand to access
			a super-class member of the same name or the super class constructor.
			This can be achieved with a special syntax for the constructor and for
			names based on the <keyword>super</keyword> keyword, as follows:
			<tscript>
class Person
{
	private:
		var m_name;
		var m_address;                                                      # m_name and m_address can only be accessed in Person

    protected:
        var m_example = 1;                                                  # m_example can be accessed in Person and in Person's heirs

	public:
		constructor(name, address)
		{
			m_name = name;
			m_address = address;
		}

		function description()
		{ return "name: " + m_name + "\\naddress: " + m_address + "\\n"; }  # the constructor and the function description can be accessed from anywhere
}

class Customer : Person
{
	private:
		var m_customerID;

    public:
		constructor(id, name, address):super(name, address)
		{ m_customerID = id; }

		function description()
		{
            # print(super.m_name);                                            # this does not work, since m_name is not visible in this slope

            print(super.m_example);                                           # this does work, since m_example is protected and therefore visible for Customer

            return "id: " + m_customerID + "\\n" + super.description();
        }
}

			Namespaces can only be declared at global scope or within other

			namespace.

				<p><a href="?doc#/language/types/dictionary">Dictionary</a>
				literals are comma-separated sequences of key-value pairs enclosed
				in curly braces. A key-value pair consists of a key, which is either
				a string or an identifier, and a value, which is the result of an
				arbitrary expression:
				<ebnf>
					dictionary = empty-dictionary | nonempty-dictionary ;
					  empty-dictionary = "{" "}" ;
					  nonempty-dictionary = "{" key-value { "," key-value } [ "," ] "}" ;
					  key-value = (string | identifier) ":" expression ;
				</ebnf>
				The key-value pairs become the items of the
				dictionary literal. Importantly, the identifier is not looked up as
				a name, but it represents the string that would arise if it were
				enclosed in double quotes, so using identifiers instead of strings
				for keys is merely syntactic sugar that saves typing the double
				quotes. Keys are string tokens, not string literals, and hence cannot
				span multiple lines.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note that not all keys can be represented with the identifier
				short-notation, simply because they are not valid identifiers. Also
				note that this means that string variables cannot act as keys in
				string literals; this can be achieved with the
				<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/item-access">item access operator</a>.
				</p>
				<div class="example">
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<tscript>
						var a = {};             # empty dictionary
						# identifier keys:
						var b = {name: "Sam", phone: "911", age: 35};
						# non-identifier keys:
						var c = {"name": "Sam", "phone": "911", "age": 35};
						var d = {"---": math.sin(2), "true": math.cos(2)};

						# item access:
						print(b["name"]);

				An anonymous function or lambda function follows the syntax:
				<ebnf>
					lambda = "function" [ closure ] "(" param-list ")" func-body ;
					  closure = "[" [ closure-param { "," closure-param } ] "]" ;
					  closure-param = [ identifier "=" ] expression ;
					  param-list = [ param-decl { "," param-decl } ] ;
					  param-decl = identifier [ "=" constant-ex ] ;
					  constant-ex = $ expression that evaluates to a constant $ ;
					  func-body = "{" { declaration | statement | directive } "}" ;
				</ebnf>
				In contrast to a <a href="?doc#/language/declarations/functions">function
				declaration</a> it does not have a name by which is could be referenced.
				However, being an expression it can be stored in a variable or returned
				from a function. An anonymous function is of type
				<a href="?doc#/language/types/function">Function</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Anonymous functions can enclose variables from their surrounding scopes,
				which are stored in the function object. In fact, the result of arbitrary
				expressions can be stored. These expressions are evaluated when the
				anonymous function is created. They are available from inside the
				function body when the function is invoked, which can be at a later time
				and, importantly, from a different scope. In the following (somewhat
				contrived) example, the variable <code class="code">square</code> is not
				accessible from the global scope where <code class="code">lambda</code>
				is defined, yet the variable is available inside the anonymous function
				because its value is enclosed in the function as a closure parameter.
				</p>

				Lambda functions do not have a name, therefore they cannot be referred
				to by name. This is a problem when writing recursive algorithms, since
				the function must be able to call itself. To allow for recursion, the
				<keyword>this</keyword> keyword refers to the function itself. Hence,
				the following code computes the factorial of a number:
				</p>
				<div class="example">
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<tscript>
						var fac = function(n)
							{
								if n == 0
								then return 1;
								else return n * this(n-1);
							};
						print(fac(7));   # 5040
					</tscript>
				</div>
				<p>
				Note that writing the else-case as
				<code class="code">else return n * fac(n-1);</code> does not work
				because <code class="code">fac</code> is a variable that cannot be
				used until it is fully initialized, and the else-statement is part
				of the initializer.
				</p>
				<p>
				When invoking a lambda function, all closure variables are
				<i>copied</i> into the local frame. Hence, any modification of a
				closure variable is limited to the duration of the function
				execution.

				<h2>Definition of Value Equality</h2>
				<p>
				The definition of value equality depends on the type. For built-in atomic
				types like boolean, integers, reals and strings, two values are equal if
				they are of the same type and they hold the same boolean, number or string.
				In particular the integer <code class="code">2</code> and the real number
				<code class="code">2.0</code> compare equal, but they differ from the
				string <code class="code">"2"</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Containers are considered equal if they are of the same type and all of
				their keys and items are equal. Care must be taken to avoid recursive
				references, see below.
				</p>
				<p>
				Ranges are equal if begin and end are equal numbers. Types compare equal
				only if they represent the same built-in type or class. Functions compare
				equal if calling them invokes the same TScript code. For methods, the
				object must agree in addition, and for closures, all enclosed parameters
				must compare equal.
				</p>
				<p>
				There is currently no meaningful way to compare objects, even within the
				same class. Therefore all objects are considered different, and the check
				for equality coincides with the check for identity performed by the
				standard library function <a href="">same</a>. Classes that inherit the
				built-in types are compares like these, while their attributes are
				ignored.

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<p>
			A function call is an expression with the following syntax:
			<ebnf>
				function-call = expression "(" argument { "," argument } ")" ";" ;          '# example("example");'
				argument = [ identifier "=" ] expression ;
			</ebnf>
			The first expression must resolve to a callable object, hereafter
			referred to as the function for short, which is a
			<a href="?doc#/language/declarations/functions">function</a> or
			<a href="?doc#/language/declarations/classes">method</a> declaration,
			a <a href="?doc#/language/types">type</a>, or an
			<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/literals/anonymous-functions">anonymous function</a>.
			The arguments must match the function's parameters.
			</p>

			<h2>Control Flow</h2>
			<p>
			The effect of the call is that a new stack frame is created with
			one local variable per parameter. These parameter variables are
			initialized to the values of the arguments. Then the control flow
			continues at the beginning of the function body. After the function
			returns, either by means of an explicit
			<a href="?doc#/language/statements/return">return</a> statement or when
			reaching the end of its body, the return value becomes the value
			of the function call expression, the stack frame is removed, and
			the program continues in the original frame.
			</p>

			<h2>Positional and Named Arguments</h2>
			<p>
			In simple cases there is exactly one argument for each parameter
			of the function. The matting between arguments are parameters is
			determined by their order. Such arguments are called <i>positional</i>
			arguments.
			</p>
			<p>
			If a parameter of a function specifies a default value then the
			corresponding argument can be dropped. A neat way of providing
			values only for some parameters is to use <i>named</i> arguments,
			i.e., arguments with <ebnf>identifier "="</ebnf>
			present. Named arguments must not be followed by positional arguments,
			since that would be extremely confusing and error-prone. Also
			arguments without default values can be specified by name, although
			this is not required.

			The second (index) expression must resolve to a valid

			</p>
			<p>
			The result of an item access depends on the base type and

			The declaration a name refers to is determined by the name
			lookup rules found below.
			</p>

			<h2>Scopes and Visibility of Names</h2>
			<p>
			TScript imposes strict rules on the visibility of declarations
			based on scopes.
			In TScript, every block enclosed in curly braces is a scope.
			Scopes can apparently be nested, as in the following example,
			which contains five scopes: the global scope, a class, a
			function, and two blocks.
			<tscript>
				var a;
				{
					var x;
					class Cl
					{
					public:
						function m()
						{
							x = 99;
							# y = 99;  # error: y is not yet defined
						}
					}
					var y;
					{
						# z = 1;   # error: z is not yet defined
						var z;
						z = 2;
					}
					a = 42;
					x = 42;
					y = 42;
					# z = 42;      # error: cannot access z from here
				}
			</tscript>
			Names of variables, functions, classes and namespaces declared
			within a scope are only visible from within that scope, and from
			within sub-scopes. They are neither visible before they are declared,
			nor after their enclosing scope ends. This makes it possible to have
			multiple declarations of the same name, as along as they are found in
			different scopes. The name always refers to the declaration in the
			innermost scope:
			<tscript>
				var a = 1;
				{
					print(a);   # prints 1
					var a = 2;
					{
						print(a);       # prints 2
						var a = 3;
						print(a);       # prints 3
						# var a = 4;    # error; the name 'a' is already
						                # defined in this scope
					}
					print(a);   # prints 2
				}
				print(a);   # prints 1
			</tscript>
			This means that declarations of the same name mask each other, but
			they do not result in errors.
			</p>

			<h2>Namespaces</h2>
			<p>
			Declarations defined inside a namespace are accessed with the dot
			operator:
			<tscript>
			namespace N {
				var a;
				function say() { print("a = " + a); }
			}
			# a = 7;     # the enclosing scope of 'a' is not visible
			# say();     # the enclosing scope of 'say' is not visible
			N.a = 7;     # works as desired
			N.say();     # works as desired
			</tscript>
			This works because the <code class="code">namespace N</code> is visible
			from the perspective of the statement. Its members
			<code class="code">a</code> and <code class="code">say</code> are not directly visible,
			however, they can be accessed as members of <code class="code">N</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
			When accessing members of a namespace many times it can be
			convenient to make names from a namespace directly available in the
			current scope:
			<tscript>
			namespace N {
				var a;
				function say() { print("a = " + a); }
			}
			use namespace N;   # make all names from N visible
			a = 7;       # now this works!
			say();       # now this works!
			N.a = 7;     # this also still works
			N.say();     # this also still works
			</tscript>
			Names can even be imported into classes. Then variables and functions
			defined in the namespace can be accessed like static members of the
			class.
			</p>

			<h2>Names in Classes and Super Classes</h2>
			<p>
			The above rules also apply within classes. In particular, names must
			be declared before they are used. This implies that in TScript
			attributes are usually declared first to make them accessible for
			methods:
			<tscript>
			class A
			{
			private:
				var x;
			public:
				function f()
				{
					print(x);
					# print(y);   # error; y was not declared yet
				}
			private:
				var y;
			}
			</tscript>
			</p>
			<p>
			Inside a class it is possible to access the public and protected
			members of all super classes, although they are declared in unrelated
			scopes:
			<tscript>
			class A
			{
			protected:
				var m, n;
			}
			class B : A   # B inherits A, and therefore its members m and n
			{
			public:
				var n;
				function set(value)
				{
					m = value;         # access to m works
					n = value;         # sets B.n
					super.n = value;   # sets A.n
				}
			}
			</tscript>
			</p>

			<h2>Name Lookup</h2>
			<p>
			When TScript encounters a name, then it proceeds as follows.
			It checks all scopes for a declaration with the given name,
			starting from the innermost scope and moving towards enclosing
			scopes until the global scope is processed. For each scope, it
			does the following:
			<ul>
				<li>If the name is defined inside of the scope and before
					its use, then the lookup is successful.</li>
				<li>If the name is imported from a namespace into the scope
					before its use, then the lookup is successful.</li>
				<li>If the scope is a class, then loop through the chain of
					super classes, starting at the current class. If the
					name is defined in a class, or if it is imported from a
					namespace, then the name lookup is successful.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			These rules imply that some names refer to objects that are not
			accessible, like in the following example:
			<tscript>
			function f()
			{
				var x = 7;
				function g()
				{
					# return x + 1;   # error!
				}
				return g;
			}
			var h = f();
			print(h);     # prints &lt;Function g&gt;
			print(h());
			</tscript>
			The problem is that when g is called under the name h in the last
			line, then x has already gone out of scope. This can be avoided
			by turning g into a closure:
			<tscript>
			function f()
			{
				var x = 7;
				return function [x] ()
				{
					return x + 1;   # works
				};
			}
			var h = f();
			print(h);     # prints &lt;Function anonymous 4:11&gt;
			print(h());   # prints 8
			</tscript>

					title: "Precedence of Operations",
					content: `
			<h2>Order of Evaluation of Expressions and Operators</h2>
			<p>
			Different operators have different precedence, i.e., binding
			strength. In the following example, the order of operations
			depends on the binding strength of the operators:
			</p>
			<tscript>
				var x = [2, 3, 5, 7];
				var i = 4 - 1 * 2;
				var a = -2^x[i];
			</tscript>
			<p>
			In the second line the usual mathematical convention that multiplication
			is computed before addition is expected. This is realized in TScript by
			giving <code class="code">operator&nbsp;*</code> a higher precedence
			(binding strength) than <code class="code">operator&nbsp;+</code>.
			Though, a higher precedence is traditionally expressed by a lower number,
			see the table below.
			</p>
			<p>
			Similarly, the minus sign in the last statement is applied to the
			power, not only to its base, since the exponentiation
			<code class="code">operator&nbsp;^</code> binds stronger than the arithmetic negation
			<code class="code">operator&nbsp;-</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also for operators of the equal precedence the evaluation order can matter
			for the result, as in <code class="code">7 - 4 - 3</code>. Furthermore,
			expressions can have side-effects, the order of which depends on the
			evaluation order. In TScript, the evaluation order is always well-defined.
			Operators of the same precedence and the expressions in between are
			evaluated either left-to-right or right-to-left.
			</p>

			<h2>Precedence and Evaluation Order Rules</h2>
			<p>
			The precedence rules are summarized in the following table.
			</p>
			<table class="nicetable">
				<tr><th>precedence</th><th>operator type</th><th>operators</th><th>evaluation order</th></tr>
				<tr><td>0</td><td>right&nbsp;unary</td><td><code class="code">[]</code> <code class="code">.</code></td><td>left-to-right</td></tr>

				<tr><td>5</td><td>binary</td><td><code class="code">:</code></td><td>left-to-right</td></tr>

				<tr><td>7</td><td>left&nbsp;unary</td><td><code class="code">not</code></td><td>right-to-left</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>binary</td><td><code class="code">and</code></td><td>left-to-right</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9</td><td>binary</td><td><code class="code">or</code> <code class="code">xor</code></td><td>left-to-right</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10</td><td>assignment</td><td><code class="code">=</code> <code class="code">+=</code> <code class="code">-=</code> <code class="code">*=</code> <code class="code">/=</code> <code class="code">\/\/=</code> <code class="code">%=</code> <code class="code">^=</code></td><td>right-to-left</td></tr>
			</table>

			<h2>Parentheses</h2>
			<p>
			Every part of an expression can be enclosed in parentheses, which
			bind stronger than all operators. The most common reason is to
			override operator precedence, as in the following example:
			<tscript>
				var a = 2;
				var b = (3 + a) * 6;

			Constants are expressions that do not depend on the values

			</p>
			<p>
			All <a href="?doc#/language/expressions/literals">literals</a> of
			non-container types are constants. This includes all
			<a href="?doc#/concepts/design">JSON</a> types, but also
			functions (excluding non-static methods). Array and dictionary

				var n = [c2, c3];               # not a constant
			</tscript>
			The last expression is not a constant since c2 and c3 are
			variables.

			<p>

			return values of functions without side-effects with constant
			parameters, e.g.,
			<tscript>
				var n = math.sqrt(2);           # not a constant
			</tscript>

				  lhs = name

			</ebnf>
			The expression <ebnf>lhs</ebnf> on the left-hand-side (lhs) of the
			assignment must refer to a variable. It must not refer to a function
			or to a constant.
			</p>
			<p>
			Assignments are evaluated from right to left: the <ebnf>expression</ebnf>
			on the right-hand-side (rhs) is evaluated before the <ebnf>lhs</ebnf>. The
			effect of an assignment with <code class="code">operator =</code> is
			that the variable referenced by the <ebnf>lhs</ebnf> is overwritten
			with the result of the <ebnf>expression</ebnf>. In other words, after
			the assignment the variable references the value to which the rhs
			evaluates. Note that an assignment does not copy the value represented by
			the rhs, it only makes the lhs reference the same value, as can be seen in
			the following example:

				var a = [2, 3, 5, 7];

			binary arithmetic <a href="?doc#/language/expressions/binary-operators">operators</a>.
			However, this equivalence is not exact in general, since with compound
			assignment the lhs expression is evaluated only once. This difference
			is demonstrated in the following example:

				var counter = 0;

				function get()
				{

			A for-loop has the following syntax:
			<ebnf>
			for-loop = "for" [ loop-var "in" ] expression "do" statement ;
			  loop-var = ("var" identifier) | name ;
			</ebnf>
			The <ebnf>expression</ebnf> must evaluate to a
			<a href="?doc#/language/types/range">Range</a> or an
			<a href="?doc#/language/types/array">Array</a>, otherwise an error is
			reported.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<tscript>
					# print 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 in five lines
					for var i in 3:8 do print(i*i);

					# print "hello" and "world" in two lines
					for var i in ["hello", "world"] do print(i);
				</tscript>
			</div>
			<p>
			The for-loop executes the <ebnf>statement</ebnf> exactly once for
			each value in the range or array. This value is assigned to the loop
			variable. An already declared variable can be used as the loop
			variable, which is referenced by the given <ebnf>name</ebnf>, so it
			can even be declared in another namespace.
			Alternatively, a new variable can declared with the
			<ebnf>"var" identifier</ebnf> syntax. This variable belongs to the
			loop, which acts as its scope, hence its name does not collide with
			other declarations outside the loop, and the variable goes out of
			scope after the last loop iteration. It is common to execute
			multiple statements in each loop iteration by using a
			<a href="?doc#/language/statements/blocks">block</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Repeated Execution</h2>
			<p>
			Looping over a range is the idiomatic way to execute code a number
			of times in a row. The loop counter provides an easy way to
			parameterize the repeated code:
			<tscript>
				for var i in 0:10 do print(10-i + "...");
				print("now!");
			</tscript>
			In simple contexts the loop variable is not needed. Consequently,
			it can be dropped:
			<tscript>
				for 0:10 do print("wait...");
				print("now!");
			</tscript>
			</p>

			<h2>Looping over Containers</h2>
			<p>
			Looping over an array works directly with a for-loop. For a
			dictionary it is not clear whether the loop variable shall hold
			keys, values, or both. Therefore an explicit decision must be
			made by the programmer, using the Dictionary methods
			<a href="?doc#/language/types/dictionary">keys</a> or
			<a href="?doc#/language/types/dictionary">values</a>, as shown in
			the following example:
			<tscript>
				var dict = {a: 3, b: 10, c: null};
				for var i in dict.keys() do print(i + ": " + dict[i]);
				for var i in dict.values() do print(i);
			</tscript>
			Since arrays also have keys and values() methods, this technique can
			loop over containers (arrays and dictionaries) in a generic fashion:
			<tscript>
				var arr = [3, 10, null];
				var dict = {a: 3, b: 10, c: null};

				function printContainer(container)
				{
					print(Type(container));
					for var i in container.keys() do
					{
						print(i + ": " + container[i]);
					}
				}

				printContainer(arr);
				printContainer(dict);
			</tscript>
			</p>

			<h2>Modifying the Container in the Loop</h2>
			<p>
			It is safe to modify the object iterated over during execution of the loop.
			The loop is entirely unaffected by such modification because it iterates
			over a copy of the object. For example, the following is not an infinite loop:
			</p>
			<tscript>
				var arr = ["foo"];
				for var i in arr do arr.push(i);
				print(arr);   # prints [foo,foo]
			</tscript>

			<h2>Changing the Control Flow</h2>
			<p>
			Equally well, modifying the loop variable does not have an effect on the
			control flow, because in the next iteration the variable is assigned the
			next value from the container:
			<tscript>
				for var i in 0:10 do
				{
					if i == 3 then i = 7;   # attempt to skip 3,4,5,6 fails
					print(i);   # prints 0, 1, 2, <span style="color:red">7</span>, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
				}
			</tscript>
			</p>
			<p>
			Sometimes it is necessary to change the control flow during execution
			of the loop. We have seen that modifying the loop variable and the
			loop object does not achieve this effect. Instead, the following two
			operations work.
			The loop a a whole can be aborted with <a href="?doc#/language/statements/break-continue">break</a>.
			The current iteration can be aborted with <a href="?doc#/language/statements/break-continue">continue</a>.
			It is not possible to extend a for loop during execution. If this is
			a requirement then a
			<a href="?doc#/language/statements/while-do-loops">while-do-loop</a>
			can be used.

			<h2>Syntax and Effect</h2>
			<p>
			An exception is thrown with the following syntax:
			<ebnf>
				throw = "throw" expression ";" ;
			</ebnf>
			The result of evaluating the <ebnf>expression</ebnf> is called
			an exception.
			The effect of throwing an exception is that execution continues
			in the <keyword>catch</keyword>-part of the closest enclosing
			<keyword>try</keyword>-<keyword>catch</keyword> block.
			The search for the closest enclosing <keyword>try</keyword> block
			works as follows. The current scope is left until a
			<keyword>try</keyword> block, global scope, or a function scope
			is found. In case of a <keyword>try</keyword> block the search
			is successful, and the exception is assigned to the variable
			declared in the <keyword>catch</keyword> block. Otherwise the
			runtime system leaves the current function and continues the
			search in the calling function. If no <keyword>try</keyword>-block
			is found before global scope is encountered, then the program
			terminates with an error message, which contains a string
			representation of the exception.
			</p>

			<h2>Error Handling</h2>
			<p>
			Exceptions are regularly used for error reporting across possibly
			deeply nested function calls. The role of the exception is to
			provide a useful description of the error, which can be either
			handled programmatically by the catch block, or reported to the
			user.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sometimes only certain types of errors should be handled in a
			specific <keyword>catch</keyword> block. In this case the
			exception can be caught, examined, and possibly re-thrown.

			<h2>Syntax</h2>

		<p>
		A type defines a set of values, which are of similar nature.
		They are associated with operations acting on the value, i.e.,
		evaluating or manipulating values. The available data types
		therefore define how information can be represented natively,
		which units of information can be processed atomically, and
		how information can be aggregated.
		</p>
		<p>
		TScript's core type system is rather minimal. It does not aim
		for completeness, but it is extensible. For example, there is
		no built-in type representing a date, but it is easy enough to
		add a class taking that role.
		</p>
		<p>
		Not all types represent typical units of information, like bits,
		numbers, and strings. Two such types are Function and Type. The
		ability to use functions as types enables powerful programming
		techniques. Types as values are used to check for the types of
		variables referenced by variables at runtime.
		</p>
		<p>
		Programmers can extend the type system to new kinds of information
		by writing their own classes. Simple classes like a date class can
		behave similar to atomic types. More complex classes can for
		example act as containers, or represent resources (like files).
		Classes support proper information hiding, which allows the
		programmer to separate implementation details from a public
		interface.
		</p>
		<p>
		TScript does not distinguish between built-in types and classes,
		in the sense that all types are equally capable of taking each role.
		For example, it is perfectly legal to use a built-in type like
		Integer as a super class, which might make sense for a date class.
		However, it is not possible to overload operators. For classes, the
		capabilities of operators must therefore be emulated with functions.

			The type Real represents floating point numbers according to the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754 standard</a>.
			This number format offers an excessive range and a precision of
			about 15-16 decimal digits. Although the precision is more than
			sufficient for most tasks, one should be aware of its limitations
			like rounding errors, which can result in catastrophic cancellation.
			These aspects have been discussed in detail in

			<h2>Operations</h2>

			Reals can be combined with a number of unary and binary operators.
			When the result of such an operator is outside the floating point range
			then the result <i>underflows</i> (to zero) or <i>overflows</i> (to
			positive or negative infinity). Being aware of this behavior is important
			when dealing with large numbers, in particular since the operations are
			not fully consistent from an algebraic perspective. Computations with
			infinite values easily result in undefined results, which are encoded by
			the special value NaN (not-a-number).

			</p>

			<h2>Operations</h2>
			<p>
			Ranges offer two rather trivial operations, both by means of the
			<a href="?doc#/language/expressions/item-access">item access operator</a>,
			namely access of items by index and slicing. The behavior is designed
			to mimic that of an array holding the elements of the range as items:
			<tscript>
				var range = 10:15;   # pretend: var range = [10,11,12,13,14];
				print(range[3]);     # prints 13
				print(range[-2:2]);  # prints 10:12
			</tscript>
			Item access with an integer index requires that the index is valid,
			i.e., it is non-negative and less than the size of the range, which
			is defined as max(<i>end-begin</i>,&nbsp;0). Slicing access with another
			range does not require all indices to be valid, and the resulting range
			is clipped to the valid range.
			</p>
			<p>
			Two ranges compare equal if and
			only if begin and end coincide. This means that two empty ranges with
			different begin and end do not compare equal, although they represent the
			same (empty) set of integers. Ranges are not ordered.
			</p>

			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<table class="methods">
			<tr><th>constructor</th><td>
				The <code class="code">constructor(begin, end)</code> creates a
				new range from begin to end. Both arguments must be integers, or
				reals representing integer values.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th>size</th><td>
				<code class="code">function size()</code> returns the size of
				the range.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th>begin</th><td>
				<code class="code">function begin()</code> returns the begin of
				the range.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th>end</th><td>
				<code class="code">function end()</code> returns the end of
				the range.
			</td></tr>

			<p>
			The values of type Type represent types, i.e., built-in types and
			classes. They are immutable. A type value can be constructed from
			any value.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<tscript>
					var a = [];
					var t = Type(a);
					print(t);       # &lt;Type Array&gt;
					print(Array);   # &lt;Type Array&gt;
					if t == Array then print("a is an array");

					var tt = Type(t);
					print(tt);      # &lt;Type Type&gt;
					var ttt = Type(tt);
					print(ttt);     # &lt;Type Type&gt;

					var b = t(3:8); # construct a new Array from a range using "t"
					print(b);       # [3,4,5,6,7]
				</tscript>
			</div>
			<p>
			Type values are useful for three purposes:
			<ol>
			<li>
				Testing at runtime whether a value is of a specific type.
				For example, this allows to test whether a number is an
				integer or a real, and hence for determining whether
				<a href="?doc#/language/types/integer">integer</a> or
				<a href="?doc#/language/types/real">floating point</a> arithmetic
				is used when applying an operator.
			</li>
			<li>
				Constructing new objects of a type determined at runtime,
				e.g., in a factory pattern.
			</li>
			<li>
				Type values can access static members of classes:
				<tscript>
					class A
					{
					public:
						static var s = 18;
					}

					var a = A();
					var t = Type(a);
					print(a.s);   # prints 18
					print(t.s);   # prints 18
				</tscript>
			</li>
			</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>Operations</h2>
			<p>
			Type values do not offer any operations other than the function call
			operator, which invokes the constructor of the type, and the member
			access operator, which accesses static members of the class.
			Two type values compare equal if they refer to the same type. Types
			are not ordered.
			</p>

			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<table class="methods">
			<tr><th>constructor</th><td>
				The <code class="code">constructor(value)</code> creates a new
				type object. It describes the type of <i>value</i>.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th>superclass</th><td>
				<code class="code">static function superclass(type)</code>
				returns a type object representing the direct super class of
				the given <i>type</i>, or null if the it does not have a super
				class.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th>isOfType</th><td>
				<code class="code">static function isOfType(value, type)</code>

			</td></tr>
			<tr><th>isDerivedFrom</th><td>
				<code class="code">static function isDerivedFrom(subclass, superclass)</code>
				tests whether <i>subclass</i> inherits <i>superclass</i> as a direct
				or indirect base (including the case that the types coincide).

			A Class is a user-defined type. It is created through a

			Classes allow the programmer to extend the

			up the whole world of
			<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a>,
			a programming paradigm in which data and functionality is organized
			into objects, which are instances of classes. Objects organize data
			into semantically meaningful units. Classes bind functions operating
			on these chunks to the corresponding object. Classes define a public
			(possibly a protected) interface, defining the functionality. The
			implementation of the functionality is opaque to the user of a class
			or object, and hence allows the implementer to modify implementation
			details without affecting the outside world. This principle is known
			as "encapsulation" or "information hiding". Furthermore, classes can
			extend existing types through (single) inheritance.

			<h2>Demonstration of Class Features</h2>
			<p>
			The following is a non-trivial example of a (rather minimal) class
			representing a date.
			</p>
			<tscript>
				# The Date class represents a date as the number of days since
				# 01.01.1970. The range is limited to years 1970 to 2099, for
				# ease of leap year handling. Objects store this value in an
				# integer, not in a member variable, but by inheriting type
				# Integer. In an object oriented view this means that a Date
				# *is* an integer. This design makes the integer operators
				# for arithmetics and comparison available for dates. The
				# class is based on the Gregorian calendar, and the date
				# format is European: "day.month.year", not "year, month day".
