	<p>
	Sometimes error messages can be really confusing. Experienced
	programmers know how to read and interpret even seemingly obscure
	errors, and they have adapted to the oddities of their tools.
	However, beginners can get lost rather quickly when trying to
	understand the root cause of an error.
	One reason for difficult to understand error messages is that in
	some situations the parser or interpreter emitting the message would
	have to guess in order to determine the most probable cause of the
	error, while reporting only the symptoms down the road is easy.
	</p>
	<div class="example">
		<h3>Example</h3>
		Say, the programmer accidentally deleted a brace closing a
		scope. Then an error message may complain that a closing brace
		is missing at the end of the program. Or it may complain that a
		constructor is allowed only inside of a class, as in the example
		below.
		<tscript>
		class A
		{
		public:
			var x;
			function set(y)
			{
				if x == y then {
					x = y;
				}  # <-- what happens if this closing brace is removed?
				x = 3 / y;
			}
			constructor()
			{
				x = 0;
			}
		}
		</tscript>
		Assume that the marked brace was accidentally deleted.
		What the programmer perceives is that according his code layout
		the constructor is indeed part of the class, so the error does
		not seem to make any sense. In contrast, TScript sees the
		constructor as being declared within function
		<code class="code">set</code>, because it
		keeps interpreting closing braces differently than the programmer
		until it finally encounters an unresolvable situation and
		reports an error. By the time it encounters the constructor it
		knows nothing about the class being never closed by a brace,
		from which a really smart program may then be able to narrow down
		the error, or at least conclude that the error's root cause could
		possibly be found in many different places.
	</div>
	<p>
	Such situations are hard to avoid in entirety. Therefore, when
	encountering a strange error it is helpful to understand how error
	messages come about. For sure, the true cause of the error is found
	<i>before</i> the reported error position, and as the above example
	demonstrates, it may be far from the position where an error is
	finally reported. More often than not, the true error is in the
	statement <i>just preceding</i> the one where an error is reported.
	In addition to such general but somewhat limited insights, this
	section aims to help by explaining in detail what each error message
	means, how it typically occurs, and which pitfalls one should be
	aware of.
	</p>

	<h2>Placeholders</h2>
	<p>
	Many error messages in this documentation contain placeholders like
	'X' and 'Y'. In an actual error message, these placeholders are
	replaced with actual names. For example, the error message
	<b>cannot order type 'X'</b> in the documentation could appear in a
	real context as <b>cannot order type 'Dictionary'</b>.
