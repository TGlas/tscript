            With containers we have learnt to deal with much data. But what,
            if we have to handle many instances of inherent information, i.e.
            personal data of employees? We might use an array full of dictionaries
            containing everything but doing so, we hadn't bound inherent data. 
            The concept of object-oriented programming helps us out. Instead of
            using dictionaries we create objects which have specific properties 
            shared by every instance of the object class. Imagine "dog" being an
            object class with every specific dog being an instance of the class.
            Every dog shares specific properties like its name, height, weight, 
            etc. Those properties are variables that every object of a specific 
            class possesses but which's values are different. Besides variables
            classes have so called methods which are functions that specifically 
            operate on objects. Since functions often only work on objects from 
            a specific class, object-oriented programming binds such functions
            to their class. Take the dog-example. Since every dog is able to bark,
            we might have a bark-function, that shall just print "Woof". Such a 
            function would not make any sense to be called without a dog, we 
            therefore model the bark-function to be a method from the dog-class.

            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p>
            To create a class we use the keyword "class", followed up by an 
            identifier. We then create a slope, in which we specify the class'
            properties:
            <tscript>
            class Dog
            {
                public:
                    var name;
                    var height, weight;

                    function bark() {
                        print(name + " woofs!");
                    }
            }
            </tscript>
            We have now created a class Dog with name, height and weight as 
            properties and a function bark() as its method. Don't worry about
            the public-keyword for now. To create an instance of this class,
            a so called object, we call the class by name, followed by two
            brackets. To access an object's values we call the object by name, 
            followed by a dot and the identifier of the value that we want to 
            access:
            <tscript>
            var d = Dog();
            d.name = "Yuma";

            d.bark();           # prints "Yuma woofs!"
            </tscript>
            Note that at this point, the height and weight variables carry the
            null value. We'd first need to assign any meaningful value to them.
            There are properties, every object of a class possesses. To always
            specifically assign values for them with each initialization of an
            object is not only tedious but also error prone. A constructor is
            a method that targets this problem. When initializing a class object
            the constructor is called. You can therefore determine what shall
            happen everytime an object is created. If no constructor is specified, 
            the empty constructor is called which just creates an object of the
            class as in the previous examples. The constructor works like a 
            function, we can hand over as many parameters as we like:
            <tscript>
            class Dog {
                public:
                    var name;
                    var height, weight;

                    constructor(name, height, weight) {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.height = height;
                        this.weight = weight;
                    }

                    function bark() {
                        print(name + " woofs!");
                    }
            }

            var d = Dog("Yuma", 5, 10);
            d.bark();                           # prints "Yuma woofs!"
            </tscript>
            With this constructor we are able to ensure that every property, 
            that might be needed will be initialized at run time. In this example 
            you also encountered the keyword <i>this</i> for the first time. It 
            returns the object, whose function has been called.
            </p>
            <p>
            Everything listed below the <i>public/i>-keyword can be accessed from any-
            where in and outside of the class:
            <tscript>
            class P {
                public:
                    var x = 1;

                    function y() {
                        print(this.x);      # accessable
                    }
            }

            var p = P();
            print(p.x);                     # accessable
            </tscript>
            The opposite to the <i>public</i>- is the <i>private</i>-keyword. <i>Private</i>
            properties and methods are only accessible inside of the class. We are able 
            to encapsulate data that is used for functionality but unintersting outside of 
            the class itself. To still be able to access private values/functions and even
            manipulate private data (if necessary), we create so called getter- and setter-
            functions:
            <tscript>
            class Dog {
                private:
                    var m_name;
                    var m_height, m_weight;

                public:
                    constructor(name, height, weight) {
                        m_name = name;
                        m_height = height;
                        m_weight = weight;
                    }

                    function getName() {
                        return m_name;
                    }

                    function setName(name) {
                        m_name = name;
                    }

                    function bark() {
                        print(m_name + " woofs!");
                    }

            }

            var d = Dog("Yuma", 10, 20);
            d.bark();                       # prints "Yuma woofs!"

            d.setName("Rudolph");
            d.bark();                       # prints "Rudolph woofs!"
            </tscript>
            Note that we cannot access the class' private properties with the <i>this</i>-keyword
            which is why we start the properties' names with an "m_". With getters and setters we 
            are able to proof the validity of the values one tries to assign to the object's properties.

            Create a class Animal with a private attribute m_name. Create a public constructor which takes
            a variable name and assigns it to m_name and a function makeNoise() which simply prints
            "<m_name> makes noise!". Don't forget to implement a getter- and setter-method for your private
            properties. Create an object of the class and name it "Ted". Call the makeNoise()-method, 
            print the current name of the object, change the name to "Todd" and finally call the 
            makeNoise()-method again.
