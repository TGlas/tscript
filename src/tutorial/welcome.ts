			<p>
			Welcome to the TScript tutorial!
			This tutorial is designed for programming beginners. Its main
			purpose is to teach you how to program a computer. Of course, it
			will do this using the TScript programming language.
			However, the general process is completely generic and transfers
			easily to other programming languages.
			</p>
			<p>
			The tutorial will guide you through a sequence of teaching units.
			Each unit is accompanied by programming tasks. This way we make sure
			that you apply the newly gained knowledge hands-on.
